# Rhythmic Priming
Code and notes from Rhythmic Priming: this time with MSE!

## What has been done so far:
1. EEG Timeseries Import and multi-scale entropy (MSE) estimation (Code: 1. EEG_Import.m)
2. Running partial least squares (PLS) on the MSE matrices averaged by task (Code: 2. MARCS_MSE_PLS.m)
3. MSE estimation on the stimulus files (Code: 3. Stimuli_MSE.m)
4. Computed Procrustes distance (more on that later) between the brain MSE and stimuli MSE (Code: 4. MSE_Procrustes.m)
